   // A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left.
   // For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array {1,2,3,4,5} , then the array would become {3,4,5,1,2} .
   // Given an array  of  integers and a number, , perform  left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.
